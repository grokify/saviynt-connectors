Preface
=======

This guide describes the integration between Saviynt **Enterprise Identity Cloud (EIC)** and Signal Sciences .

Audience
========

This guide is intended for administrators and target application integration teams responsible for implementing a secure integration service with Signal Sciences .

Introduction
============

**Signal Sciences** was a cybersecurity company that specialized in web application and API security. The company provided a cloud-native web application firewall (WAF) and runtime application self-protection (RASP) solution designed to protect web applications and APIs from various threats, including web application attacks and OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities.

**Signal Sciences** platform offered real-time threat protection, visibility, and security analytics, helping organizations defend against web application attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more. The company aimed to provide security teams with the tools and insights needed to protect their applications and APIs in modern, dynamic, and cloud-native environments.

The **Signal Sciences** connector enables you to seamlessly integrate with Signal Sciences to manage user lifecycle and govern access to their Sites.

For more information about different connectors in EIC, see  [Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud Connectors]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/EIC-Connectors/page/Content/Certified-Connectors.htm" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/EIC-Connectors/page/Content/Certified-Connectors.htm"").

**Note:** This guide provides information about using the Signal Sciences REST connector using REST API for performing operations listed in the Supported Features.

Understanding the Integration between EIC and Signal Sciences
=============================================================

You must create an integration between EIC and the collaboration platform hosted by the target application to perform import, provisioning, and deprovisioning tasks. The following components are involved in the integration:

*   The Complete Service Management platform Signal Sciences combines ITSM with ESM and SIAM capabilities, enabling all internal departments, such as IT, HR, and Facilities, as well as external service providers and customers, to collaborate securely and seamlessly on one complete platform, reducing complexity and improving productivity.
    
*   **Objects** are imported as entitlement types into EIC.
    
*   **Security System** represents the connection between EIC and the target application.
    
    *   It comprises of an endpoint, which is the target application for which you want EIC to manage the identity repository.
        
    *   It provides application instance abstraction from connectivity including high-level metadata. For more information about creating a security system, see [Creating a Security System]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/EIC-Admin-v2022x/page/Content/Chapter02-Identity-Repository/Creating-a-Security-System.htm" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/EIC-Admin-v2022x/page/Content/Chapter02-Identity-Repository/Creating-a-Security-System.htm"").
        
*   **Endpoint** is an instance of an application within the context of a security system.
    
    *   It is the target application or application from which the connector imports the data and performs provisioning or deprovisioning of identity objects, such as users, accounts, and entitlements.
        
    *   It is mandatory to create an endpoint after creating the security system.  
        You can associate a single security system with multiple endpoints if the deployment involves modelling of multiple isolated virtual applications (based on sets of specific entitlements according to certain categories) within a single application instance. For more information about creating an endpoint, see [Creating an Endpoint for the Security System]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/EIC-Admin-v23x/page/Content/Chapter02-Identity-Repository/Creating-Endpoints.htm" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/EIC-Admin-v23x/page/Content/Chapter02-Identity-Repository/Creating-Endpoints.htm"").
        
*   **Connector** is a software component that enables communication between EIC and the target application. It provides a simplified integration mechanism where in some instances you only need to create a connection with minimal connectivity information for your target application. The REST connector is used for importing, provisioning accounts and access through the REST APIs. For more information about creating a connection, see [Creating a Connection]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Creating-a-Connection&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Creating-a-Connection&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x"").
    
*   **Job Scheduler** is a software component that executes a job based on the configured schedule to perform import or provisioning operations from EIC.  
    When a provisioning job is triggered, it creates provisioning tasks in EIC. When these tasks are completed, the provisioning action is performed on the target application through the configured connector. If you want to instantly provision requests for completing the tasks without running the provisioning job, you must enable Instant Provisioning at the security system level and the **Instant Provisioning Tasks** global configuration. For more information about the jobs used by the connectors in the Signal Sciences integration.
    

Integration Architecture
------------------------

EIC uses a **REST** connection for integrating with Signal Sciences for importing data and for performing provisioning and deprovisioning tasks.

The following diagram illustrates the integration architecture and communication with the target application

Setting Up the Integration
--------------------------

### **Prerequisites**

Perform the following steps to Generate & Setup token authentication

1.  From the **My Profile** menu, select **API Access Tokens**. The API Access Tokens menu page appears.
    
2.  Click the **Add API access token** button. The Add API Access Tokens menu page appears.
    
3.  In the **Token name** field, enter a name to identify the access token.
    
4.  Click the **Create API access token** button. The new token appears.
    
5.  Record the token in a secure location for your use.
    
    **Note:** This is the only time the token will be visible. Record the token and keep it secure. For your security, it will not appear in the console.
    
6.  Click the **Continue** button to finish creating the token.
    

### **Creating a Connection**

Connection refers to the configuration setup for connecting EIC to target applications. For more information about the procedure to create a connection, see [Creating a Connection]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Creating-a-Connection&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Creating-a-Connection&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x"").

#### **Understanding the Configuration Parameters**

While creating a connection, you must specify connection parameters that the connector uses to connect with the target application, define the type of operations to perform, the target application objects against which those operations are performed, and the frequency of performing them. In addition, you can view and edit attribute mappings between EIC and the target application, predefined correlation rules, and provisioning jobs and import jobs.

##### **Configuration Parameters for Account and Access Import**

The connector uses the following parameters for creating a connection and for importing account and access from the target application:

Using the Signal Sciences Integration
=====================================

You can use the Signal Sciences integration for performing import and provisioning operations after configuring it to meet your requirements. 

Guidelines for Using the Integration
------------------------------------

You must apply the following guidelines for configuring import: 

*   Run account import before running the access import.
    
*   Map all Signal Sciences attributes to EIC account attributes using **ImportAccountEntJSON**.
    

You must apply the following guidelines for configuring provisioning:

*   Use Java ternary operators if you want to add conditions in the provisioning parameters. You can use Java operations to tweak any attributes by using if-else conditions, substrings, or operators in the JSON for provisioning.
    

Configuring Import Operations
-----------------------------

*   **Full account import:** When configuring the connection for the first time, first perform full import to import all existing accounts from the target application to EIC. To perform full import, the invoke API gets response from the target application and maps the attributes in the target application with attributes in EIC. As part of this process, the deleted accounts are also identified and marked as suspended from import service.
    
*   **Full Access import:** When configuring the connection for the first time, first perform full import to import all existing access from the target application to EIC. To perform full import, the invoke API gets response from the target application and maps the attributes in the target application with attributes in EIC. As part of this process, the deleted entitlements are also identified and marked as inactive.
    

The import jobs are automatically created in EIC after you create a connection for the Signal Sciences integration. For more information about creating jobs, see [Data Jobs]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Job-Categories-for-Flat-Job-Control-Panel&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Job-Categories-for-Flat-Job-Control-Panel&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x"").

### **Importing Accounts and Accesses**

You must import accounts after the users are available in EIC.

**To import accounts:** 

1.  Specify the connection and import parameters. For more information, see [Account]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/SF-v2020x/page/Content/Configuring-the-Integration-for-Importing-Accounts.htm" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/SF-v2020x/page/Content/Configuring-the-Integration-for-Importing-Accounts.htm"") and [Access]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/SF-v2020x/page/Content/Configuring-the-Integration-for-Importing-Access.htm" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/SF-v2020x/page/Content/Configuring-the-Integration-for-Importing-Access.htm"") import.  
    **Note:** Ensure that the connection type is selected as **REST**.
    
2.  Configure the **Application Data Import (Single Threaded)** job to import accounts and access. For more information, see [Data Jobs]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Job-Categories-for-Flat-Job-Control-Panel&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Job-Categories-for-Flat-Job-Control-Panel&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x"").
    

Configuring Provisioning and Deprovisioning
-------------------------------------------

Provisioning is automatically enabled when a connection is configured. For detailed information about performing provisioning tasks, see [Access Request System]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=ars-mang-ur-accs&pubname=EIC-User-v2022x" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=ars-mang-ur-accs&pubname=EIC-User-v2022x"").

**To provision objects to the target application:**

1.  Specify the connection and provisioning parameters. For more information, see [Configuration Parameters for Provisioning]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/SF-v2020x/page/Content/Configuring-the-Integration-for-Provisioning-and-Deprovisioning.htm" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/bundle/SF-v2020x/page/Content/Configuring-the-Integration-for-Provisioning-and-Deprovisioning.htm"").  
    **Note:** Ensure that the connection type is selected as **REST**.
    
2.  Configure the **Provisioning** job **(WSRETRY)**. For more information, see [Provisioning Jobs]("https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Job-Categories-for-Flat-Job-Control-Panel&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x" ""https://docs.saviyntcloud.com/csh?topicname=Job-Categories-for-Flat-Job-Control-Panel&pubname=EIC-Admin-v2022x"").
    

When a provisioning job is triggered, it creates provisioning tasks in EIC. When these tasks are completed, the provisioning action is performed on the target application through the connector.

Troubleshooting
